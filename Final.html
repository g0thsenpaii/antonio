     <h1 id="Final-title">About me</h1>
     
     <p>My name is Antonio Jimenez Carrillo, and my pronouns are they/them and she/her. I am a very understanding person, so please don’t feel bad if you happen to use the wrong pronouns. I currently live in Mchenry Illinois 

I recently switched my major to informatics because I felt like it is the path I am most interested in and correlates a lot with the current job I work in. I also wanted to major in something I was passionate about rather than something I was struggling with and not enjoying. My last major was computer science, and I found that to be really hard and something I wasn't prepared for. I am considered a senior this year, but due to my major switching, I will have possibly an extra year to complete it, which isn’t an issue for me because I feel like I will be majoring in something I will enjoy more. 



What interests me about this majors is data is something that constantly needs to be organized before it can be understood properly, and in my current job, organization is key to being able to interpret the data I receive from multiple tests.

 

The current job I have is as a lab technician at Matrix Sciences, where I test various types of food from all sorts of restaurants for things such as salmonella, e-coli, and listeria. With that, I also do lots of data management with all the products we receive. I basically put the physical data into a digitized format on a spreadsheet and organize it based on what test we are running. I promise it’s not as complicated as it seems; it’s just a lot of information you need to process, but once you understand what you’re doing, it’s pretty easy.
