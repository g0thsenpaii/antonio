            <h1 id="article-title">Book sale coming soon!!!</h1>
            <p> At our monthly sale, we have over 50,000 beautiful used books, albums, DVDs, magazines, and other items. These are largely gifts from people, estates, and corporations. We also sell materials that the Palo Alto Public Library has removed from its shelves in order to create way for new purchases.</p>
            <h1 id="section-title">What to expect</h1>
            <p>
               Our Main Room is located near the Charleston Shopping Center on the north driveway (see map below). Hardbound books start at $1 in this room, and paperback books start at 50 cents. Please bring large book donations to this space as well.
               Children's books, music, videos, and toys are available in our new room (near the Cubberley track, Pavilion, and Greendell School), where many items are 50 cents or $1, including picture books, school-age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs, and books for parents and teachers. Please select no more than 12 books at a time on Saturday during the first hour of the sale and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay.Bring them to the cashier and ask them to keep them until you are ready to pay for all of your items.
               Hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50 cents each, and children's books are only 25 cents in rooms K6 and K7. Prices in the bargain room are half-off on Sunday, and you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 apiece and filling them with books. On Saturday, the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour earlier than the Main room.

            <h1 id="Final-title">Additional information</h1>
            <p>We will only let 160 customers into the Main Room at a time due to space constraints and pressing health and safety concerns. On Saturdays, consumers will be admitted in the order of their numbered tickets, which are distributed between 8 and 11 a.m. Once inside, clients may take just 12 books off the shelf before purchasing them and exiting out the east door. They can then reenter in that order by joining at the end of any lingering lines at the north door. If there is still a wait outside, the restriction of 12 books at a time will be extended until noon. These same low pricing can be found on all of our other tens of thousands of books. While some bookstores will donate a portion of your purchase to local libraries, we will donate 100%. We also don't collect sales tax and have the friendliest salespeople you'll ever meet. 
            </p>
